## Project Overview

**Role:** Data Scientist & Biostatistical Analyst
**Collaboration:** University at Buffalo - Department of Biostatistics
**Duration:** October 2025 - Present (Ongoing)
**Tech Stack:** R, PCA, Statistical Modeling, ggplot2, tidyverse

---

## Research Focus

This project involves biostatistical analysis of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) metabolomics data in collaboration with researchers at the University at Buffalo.

---

## Data & Analysis

- **Dataset:** 250 patients, 156 metabolomic features
- **Analysis Method:** Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and statistical testing
- **Key Finding:** Identified 12 metabolites with statistically significant association (p < 0.001) to GDM

---

## Impact

- **Statistical Significance:** 12 biomarkers identified with p < 0.001
- **Dimensionality Reduction:** PCA applied to high-dimensional metabolomics data
- **Publication:** Manuscript submitted to *Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism* (JCEM)
