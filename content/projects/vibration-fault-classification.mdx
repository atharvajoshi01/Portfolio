## Project Overview

**Role:** ML Engineer - Vibration Analytics
**Company:** MMS LLC
**Duration:** August 2025 - Present (Ongoing)
**Tech Stack:** MiniRocket, RidgeClassifier, Python, FFT, Signal Processing, Scikit-learn

---

## The Challenge

Industrial equipment failures cause significant downtime and safety risks. Traditional vibration analysis relies on manual inspection and rule-based alarms with high false positives. This project aims to build an automated system for predictive maintenance using machine learning.

---

## Solution

Developed a vibration analytics system that:

- **Classifies machine faults** from vibration sensor data with 99.98% accuracy
- Uses **MiniRocket + RidgeClassifier** for time series classification
- Processes vibration signals with **FFT (Fast Fourier Transform)** for feature extraction
- Enables **proactive maintenance scheduling** to prevent equipment failures
- Reduces unplanned downtime and maintenance costs

---

## Key Technologies

- **MiniRocket:** State-of-the-art time series classification algorithm
- **RidgeClassifier:** Fast, efficient linear classifier for high-dimensional features
- **FFT Analysis:** Frequency domain transformation for fault signature detection
- **Signal Processing:** Python libraries (NumPy, SciPy) for data preprocessing
- **Scikit-learn:** ML pipeline and model development

---

## Impact

- **99.98% classification accuracy** across fault types
- Real-time fault detection for industrial predictive maintenance
- Production deployment reducing equipment downtime
- Scalable ML pipeline for vibration analytics
